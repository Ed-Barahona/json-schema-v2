This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.12.1.

## Build & development

You need _Node.js_, _NPM_ and _Bower_ installed before continuing.

* Node.js: See https://nodejs.org/en/download/
* Install NPM: `sudo apt-get install npm`
* Install Bower: `npm install -g bower`
* Grunt CLI: `npm install -g grunt-cli`

You need to install the npm modules and bower components after creating a
CITC client as they are not part of this repository. Run

`npm install && bower install`

This should create two directories:

* `bower_components`
* `node_modules`

If suitable versions of any dependency cannot be found, look in bower.json to
pick the correct version. For example, if prompted with

`Unable to find a suitable version for angular, please choose one:`

Look in bower.json and see the declared dependency.

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt server` (or `grunt serve`) for preview.

Since audio files have been removed you'll need to add our own audio files:

1. Add any sound files to /app/sounds/
2. Modify the main controller (/app/scripts/controllers/main.js_)
to load new sounds files.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
